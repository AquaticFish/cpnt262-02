  **Notes:** 
    Documents within a variable helped organize things better because it is more specialized. It has been "named" as a file! Consider it a shortcut. The const is a reference that identifies the computer's document in its memory.It's important to understand that even when we can't see it, we can still remember it. But understanding the variations between these "reference" aids in validating them.

  **Self-Assessments:** 
    I believe I understand variables very well, however I find it a little more challenging to understand strings.I believe it's because I was attempting to convey it within numbers while all of the examples I've seen have often shown them through language. I would rate my self somewhere around a 7 out of 10.There always room for Improvement , especially with my string.
